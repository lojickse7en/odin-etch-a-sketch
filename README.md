# Etch-A-Sketch Project

## Objective

This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

The HTML document should be completely empty outside of the broilerplate code. Only Javascript DOM manipulation methods can be used to add elements and create the functional etch-a-sketch

## Skills Learned

- JavaScript DOM manipulation methods
- CSS Grid

## Future Iterations

- For the Etch-A-Sketch interface, have each pass add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black
- Add a clear button
- Instead of the user entering the gird density, have them use a slider instead
